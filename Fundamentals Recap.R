#Section Recap - Fundamentals
#What is a vector
#A sequence of elements, must be the same type
#Cannot mix elements

#C() Combine
#Seq() Sequence
#Rep() Replicate

#Checking what kind of vector
#is.numeric()

#Using [] 
#Accessing the element number, pass onto other elements

#In R, everything is a vector

#Vectorized operations
#recycling vectors

#Power of vectorized operations
#For loop, index variable is cyclying through functions and numbers

#Functions in R
#Remember, different functions provide different outputs

#Packages in R
#Expanding functions and outputs within R
